## What is it?

The Xfce development tools are a collection of tools and macros for
Xfce developers and people that want to build Xfce from Git In addition
it contains the Xfce developer's handbook.

## `xfce-build` containerized build environment

This project also contains the code to build and deploy xfce-build to the 
[xfce-build area on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/xfce/xfce-build/). 
This container is the build environment used by Xfce to build the various projects.
It can also be used as your own build environment as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
  --volume $(pwd):/tmp xfce/xfce-build:master /bin/bash \
  -c "cd /tmp; ./autogen.sh && make distcheck"
```

The steps to build the container are encoded in the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) in
this repository, and is built via the build job in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml).

## CI templates for Xfce

The [CI folder](ci/) contains the `build_project.yml` template for building the various
Xfce projects, as well as supporting scripts such as `build_libs.sh` which handles
building any needed dependencies. This helps us avoid repeating the same build
code in each project.
