# xfce-helpers
Just some small helpers for developing Xfce

## xfce-do-release
A quick playbook that goes through my steps when doing an Xfce release, with all the steps that could be automated.

## xfce-get-translations
I run this script when preparing the NEWS update / release notes.
You can specify the start tag/commit and end tag/commit between which you want to get all language updates.

## xfce-get-release-notes
This script is complementary to xfce-translations and gets all the commits that aren't translation updates.
